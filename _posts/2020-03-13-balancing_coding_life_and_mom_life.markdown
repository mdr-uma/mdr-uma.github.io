Having a three years old son is already full of roller coasters and on top, I’m here in Flatiron coding bootcamp. I don’t know why I challenged myself to do this  but this is getting really interesting. In the beginning I was so lost and debating myself if this is the right decision or not? Honestly , there were some moments where I just wanted to say, “I Quit” and it's absolutely normal when there is so much going around you, right? On one hand, you are diving into something which you have no idea about and on the other hand, you are still a new mom who is facing new situations everyday. 

I’m someone who needs peace to study. It’s so easy to distract me and with my 3 years, super energetic little man, it's kind of impossible to have a peaceful environment. I was getting frustrated, hopeless and discouraged when I was not being able to retain anything. Then I started noticing, It was not just me, there are so many fellow students like me who are balancing their work, family and study at the same time. Pairing with them helped me a lot to understand most of us are on the same boat. In Fact I'm the lucky one among them, who only have one child and just a part time job. Also, communicating with people who are highly motivated and positive is very helpful to me. Sometimes you just need to convince your brain that you can do it and nothing is impossible. Slowly, I begin to understand coding and I start enjoying. Now, I’m so much into coding all day along that sometimes I forget to eat or drink.

As a mother I do have a lot of responsibilities and I still struggle every single day to balance coding, work and family at the same time. Everyone has a different way to handle situations so I wont say do this or that to balance your life but one thing I can say is remind yourself that nothing is impossible and always look around people who have been struggling more than you. That helped me a lot to go through tough situations and believe in myself. 

Have a great time and all the best to everyone who is in coding journey :)
