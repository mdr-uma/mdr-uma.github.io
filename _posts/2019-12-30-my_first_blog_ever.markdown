This is my very first blog. I love writing because I can express myself better this way. I never wrote an official Blog. So this is something very interesting to me. Learning new things are part of life and everyday we learn something new. Today I’m learning, How to write BLOG? 

As I mentioned earlier, this is my first blog and honestly, I was so nervous but excited at the same time. Excited because I want to learn how to write blog and nervous because I really don’t know what blog actually is and how to write or what to write? So, I started asking people and doing research, what it actually is? How it should be? What should be the title?  And so on. I had so many questions and curiosities about it. After few researches I decided to write something about how I landed in coding boot camp? Then I saw actual blogs wrote by other students and there are so many similar topics about it. I wanted to write something very simple and different, so I thought why not about BLOG itself? After all, writing Blog is my first challenge in coding boot camp journey.
 
I’m sure we need to get used to of writing blogs in these career that’s why this is part of the boot camp and if I’m not mistaken, we have to submit total of 7 blogs during boot camp. This might not be a very good blog but I’m glad at least I started. Wish me luck for the next ones…
